# Steam workshop downloader

[Download](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/458567-steam-collection-downloader)

A simple userscript that downloads mods and mod collections from the steam workshop.

A few notes:
* It takes some time for the download to begin.
* If it stops near the end wait a few seconds/minutes.
* It should take at most 2 minutes to download around 100 items.
* Almost all Cities: Skylines mods are downloadable. Some more popular mods for other games are available but less popular ones may not be.

A huge thanks to the folks at [smods.ru](https://smods.ru/) and [steamworkshop.download](http://steamworkshop.download/). They are the ones who provide all the mod downloads <3.

Please report any bugs on my Github

have fun :)
